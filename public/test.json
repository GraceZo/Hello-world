          "Synopsis": "The Little Mermaid, visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall's live-action reimagining of the studio's Oscar®-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in cinemas May 25, 2023. The Little Mermaid is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton's daughters and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea and, while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land but ultimately places her life - and her father's crown - in jeopardy. The film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (\"grown-ish\") as Ariel; Jonah Hauer-King (\"A Dog's Way Home\") as Prince Eric; Tony Award® winner Daveed Diggs (\"Hamilton,\" \"Snowpiercer\") as the voice of Sebastian; Awkwafina (\"Raya and the Last Dragon\") as the voice of Scuttle; Jacob Tremblay (\"Luca,\" \"Room\") as the voice of Flounder; Noma Dumezweni (\"Mary Poppins Returns\") as Queen Selina; Art Malik (\"Homeland\") as Sir Grimsby; with Oscar® winner Javier Bardem (\"No Country for Old Men,\" \"Being the Ricardos\") as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award® nominee Melissa McCarthy (\"Can You Ever Forgive Me?\" \"Bridesmaids\") as Ursula. The Little Mermaid is directed by Oscar® nominee Rob Marshall (\"Chicago,\" \"Mary Poppins Returns\"), and produced by two-time Emmy® winner Marc Platt (\"Jesus Christ Superstar Live in 2 Concert,\" \"Grease Live!\"), three-time Tony Award® winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (\"Hamilton,\" \"In the Heights\"), Emmy winner John DeLuca (\"Tony Bennett: An American Classic\"), and Rob Marshall, with Jeffrey Silver (\"The Lion King\") serving as executive producer. The songs feature music from multiple Academy Award® winner Alan Menken (\"Beauty and the Beast,\" \"Aladdin\") and lyrics by Howard Ashman, who together won two Oscars for the music in the animated \"The Little Mermaid,\" and new lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. The score is by Alan Menken, with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (\"Mary Poppins Returns,\" \"Into the Woods\").",

There, Vincent meets an elite feline squad that has been protecting artwork from mice and other pests for centuries. Vincent dreams of finding a real cat family, but does not want to lose his friend Maurice, who saved his life. Vincent has to hide a friend, who also has one \"little weakness\" - Maurice loves to gnaw on masterpieces of painting. The situation becomes even more complicated when one of the greatest paintings of mankind, the Mona Lisa, arrives in the Hermitage, and it is the dream of all mice to gnaw it. But neither Vincent, nor Maurice, nor the cats of the Hermitage suspect that the painting is going to be stolen. And now Vincent will have to show all his resourcefulness and courage in order to save the masterpiece, protect the honor of the museum and win the love of a cat named Cleopatra from the Egyptian hall.",

For years, he assists the notorious Thai-Chinese military veteran in operating the syndicate out of South East Asia before moving to Hong Kong.\nFollowing the trail of information left by Cheung, Superintendent Au (by Louis Koo) leads the Narcotics Bureau to bust the syndicate, but Cheung is heavily wounded and saved by Kang in the exchange of fire which follows. The two subsequently hide away in an opium-growing village somewhere in the Golden Triangle. Helped by a local Chinese girl, Noon (by Yang Cai Yu), Cheung is on his way to recovery while Kang bands together with the militia leader Dai (by Lo Ka Leung) to rebuild his narcotics empire.\nOut in the remote wilderness, Cheung is cut-off from the outside world, but as soon as he re-establishes contact with Au, the superintendent enlists Interpolʼs help and sets off to the Golden Triangle to bring his fellow back.\nOn the streets of Thailand, Cheung reunites with Au amidst the shootout unleashed by the law enforcers and members of the cartel, who then informs him of the Thai militaryʼs imminent crack-down on Dai and that he is to revert back to the life of a cop in Hong Kong. However, refuses to leave Noon behind, Cheung hurries back to the lawless village one last time with Au. Word travels fast, and it isnʼt long before Dai receives a tip-off about Cheungʼs betrayal...\nWhat emerges in the frontline of war is a familiar face, but this time, as a friend or foe?",

But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian… albeit not the one he's looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry's only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe?

No one in their band of misfits knows anything about marching and they practice using plastic bottles and tin cans for instruments. It is a complete shambles and if they can't get their act together, they will embarrass their entire Tongan community in front of the world. However, what starts out as just a cynical scam to see a rugby game becomes a journey of self-discovery in which Maka and Veni will learn the importance of their Tongan culture.",

          "Synopsis": "Familial tensions, criminal hijinks and unexpected romance collide in the uproariously entertaining new comedy from the multi-talented Louis Garrel ('A Faithful Man'), about the misguided attempts of a dedicated son who, in trying to protect his mother, finds himself embroiled in an elaborate heist.\n\nLyon, present day. When widowed marine biologist Abel (Garrel) learns that his impulsive mum Sylvie (Anouk Grinberg) is once again re-marrying - this time to an inmate she met whilst teaching theatre in prison - he's much more than uncomfortable. Doubting that convicted burglar Michel (Roschdy Zem) is capable of turning over a new leaf, Abel's protective streak kicks in, and so with the help of his best friend Clémence (a sensational Noémie Merlant), he begins tailing his new stepfather's movements. Their amateur sleuthing is quickly uncovered by Michel and triggers an unlikely - and bold - business proposition for them both…\n\nJoyfully paying homage to the great crime capers of the French New Wave, and partly inspired by events from his own life, Garrel's witty and beautifully constructed film is a delirious mix of comedy, romance, suspense and action, with several twists too good to spoil. Selected as the special Gala Screening to celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, where it drew a thunderously positive response, this hilarious, quintessentially French comedy aims to please - and does so effortlessly.",
